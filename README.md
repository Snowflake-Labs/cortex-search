# Cortex Search

This repository contains example usage, including authentication, for the Cortex Search REST API, currently in Private Preview. The official preview documentation can be [found here](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview).

## Examples

The `examples` directory showcases several methods for searching across the documents in a Cortex Search Service. Navigate to each of the following subdirectories for installation information and sample usage for the method of choice:

1. `examples/python_sdk` for usage via the `snowflake.core` python package.
2. `examples/rest` for usage by hitting the REST API directly via python or the command line, using RSA key pair authentication with a JWT.
